This is the code for the flatsat demonstration due at the Engineering Design Review in early August of 
2014. 

Our flatsat requirements are:
-Have flight computer interface with all* hardware and use radio to receive commands and send telemetry
      to a "ground station" laptop.
-Be powered through the EPS which is plugged into a power supply to simulate the flight battery.
