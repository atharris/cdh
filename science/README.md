Science!

This directory contains the source for our system's science module. This module is responsible for obtaining 
the photometric data from space objects that our payload's mission is designed to obtain. It uses a visible light and 
a near-infrared camera, both from Smartek, and uses OpenCV in order to process these images and obtain photometric data.
